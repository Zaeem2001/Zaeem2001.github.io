        This is an application that combines emotion recognition with Spotify music playback to give the user music that fits
        the mood. The user’s PC camera provides a live video feed from which their face is detected and isolated. Then the
        program recognizes the emotion currently displayed on the user’s face and plays the appropriate public Spotify
        playlist. It accomplishes this through computer vision and machine learning tools such as OpenCV and Keras.
      </p>
      <p>
        OpenCV is a computer vision library which I used to capture and detect the user’s face in real time. The data collected
        from the user’s face is then processed by Keras, a deep learning framework. Keras compares the processed data to a model
        of possible human emotions from which the emotion most likely displayed is chosen. This emotion is then displayed on top
        of the live camera feed along with a box encompassing the user’s face. Finally, when the user presses the “play music”
        button in the GUI, Spotify will process the request and return the appropriate playlist.

        This is the final project I worked on, one that I conceptualized since the beginning of Summer 2021. Although it's been
        complete for a few weeks, it took me until now (Sept. 13th) to get everything up. This was because I’d been working on
        projects like this one all Summer and (at the time) with 2 weeks left before school, I just wanted to relax and enjoy
        the rest of my break. Nevertheless, it's here!
      </p>
      <p>
        I left this project at the bottom of my to-do-list since I didn’t think I’d be capable of bringing it to life. Working
        on my other projects during the Summer showed me just how many great (and free) resources are available on the internet.
        It also showed me that as long as I’m determined I could bring my ideas to reality, I just had to try. So, just like with
        my <a href="spotifyplayer.html" target="_blank">Spotiplayer project</a>, I searched the web for ways to have a machine recognize human emotion.
        And the web brought me to computer vision and machine learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to this project, I had very little idea what either of those terms meant. I did know that I couldn’t just throw myself
        into building my program without having some basic knowledge on these topics, so I started with research. I spent the first
        week just learning about each topic and making sure I understood the common terms and their definitions. I also found frameworks,
        libraries, and classes associated with them. I learned about OpenCV and TensorFlow, the two most common AI tools when it came to image recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it was time to put the project together (I’ll skip the details). The final product isn’t always consistent with recognizing
        emotion, however, I’m still very pleased with it. Just like with my other projects, this project has room for improvement and I will
        definitely try to improve it in the future (particularly the accuracy in emotion recognition).
